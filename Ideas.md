  * The entire system must be designed in the most decentralized way possible -- perhaps P2P might come into play?
  * While a client is in a given cosm, they will maintain a connection to the server
  * All code will run on the cosms, purely
  * Clients will have a sandbox cosm (running locally) in which they can see their favorite cosms, manage identities, etc
  * Identity will be per-user and consist of avatar information signed by the user's certificate.  The certificate will be shared across all devices
  * The protocol will be nothing more than a persistent object access protocol
